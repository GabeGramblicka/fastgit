# Welcome to Fastgit!
Fastgit is a small shell script that makes committing to your git repository much faster. 
It is designed for small or individual projects in mind

## Setup / Installation
### Linux:
Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x fastgit.sh
```

Copy it to your PATH (optional):
```
sudo cp fastgit.sh /usr/local/bin/fastgit
```

Now you can type `fastgit` from any git directory and add, commit, and push in a much more streamlined way
